## Project and Laboratory on Communication Systems

For a description of the problem to be solved take a look at [this](https://github.com/fabiobulgarella/plcs_project/blob/master/Concept%20Polito%20Workshop%2023032018.pdf) pdf.

This repository contains the source code written for the IoT device (FEZ Spider II).\
A simple [MQTT Gateway](https://github.com/fabiobulgarella/plcs_gateway) has been developed in order to enable secure data transmission between the board (which does not support TLS) and Amazon IoT.

A complete report of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/fabiobulgarella/plcs_project/blob/master/Report-049.pdf), while [here](https://github.com/fabiobulgarella/plcs_project/blob/master/Slides-049.pdf) some slides used to present it.
